/*
	This example demonstrates use of Object Pools. 
	
	As with everything in ETK, object pools do not dynamically allocate heap memory and cannot cause memory fragmentation. 
	
	Object pools contain and manage a pool of memory. They can only allocate one type of object from the pool. The object type is specified by the template parameter.
	
	When pool.alloc() is called, it constructs the object and returns a special 'pool pointer'. This pool pointer is a reference counting smart pointer. 
	It's purpose is to know when an allocation is no longer required, and return it to the pool.
	If all pool pointers to a particular allocation go out of scope or are otherwise destructed, the allocation is returned to the pool and the objects destructor is called. 
	This makes it very difficult for a memory pool to 'leak' memory. 
	
	
	Object pools are great for building linked lists, tree structures and so on where all nodes are the same type of object. 
	
	
	This particular example uses a linked list. 
	
	OUTPUT:
	
	Head node 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
	Head node 4 5 6 7 8 9 
	There are 3 objects available in the pool.

	//head->next->next->next ditto
